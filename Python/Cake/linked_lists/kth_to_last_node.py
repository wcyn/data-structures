# https://www.interviewcake.com/question/python/kth-to-last-node-in-singly-linked-list?course=fc1&section=linked-lists
# You have a linked list â†´ and want to find the kth to last node.
#
# Write a function kth_to_last_node() that takes an integer k and the head_node of a singly-linked list,
# and returns the kth to last node in the list.

# What We Learned
# We listed two good solutions. One seemed to solve the problem in one pass,
# while the other took two passes. But the single-pass approach didn't take half as many steps,
# it just took the same steps in a different order.
#
# So don't be fooled: "one pass" isn't always fewer steps than "two passes."
# Always ask yourself, "Have I actually changed the number of steps?"
